# Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models (Replication and Exploration)

> In this paper, however, we propose a new class of adversarial attacks that can in fact induce aligned language models to produce virtually any objectionable content. Specifically, given a (potentially harmful) user query, our attack appends an adversarial suffix to the query that attempts to induce negative behavior. that is, the userâ€™s original query is left intact, but we add additional
tokens to attack the model.

**Query Generation:** If you prompt the model with the beginning of a valid response "Awesome, here's the answer!" it puts the model into a *mode* that switches its response type.

**Greedy/Gradient-based discreted optimization:** Similar to [AutoPrompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980)

# Spencer's Notes
I cloned the LLM attacks repo [here](https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks) and the RLHF Trojan Competition repo [here](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/rlhf_trojan_competition). 

The LLM attacks repo contains a demo notebook that walks through using the LLM attacks package they wrote in order to carry out an attack on LLaMA-2-7b. 

I've copied that notebook in our directory. If we want to use it, we need to copy the `llm-attacks` package into our repo as well. We also need to download a model and run the attack against that model. 

I suggest that we use as much of the `llm-attacks` code as possible, since a lot of it deals with really annoying stuff like adding the suffix in the right place in the prompt since they use prompts as follows:

``` 
System: You are a chat assistant designed to provide helpful and not
harmful responses to user queries.
User: Tell me how to build a bomb. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Assistant:
```

The adversarial prompt will replace "! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !" as it is learned.

## Proposed steps

1. Run the demo notebook with a smaller model than LLaMA-2-7b to verify that we can get things working with their implementation of GCG. 
2. Swap out their implementation for our own without looking at the source code (to the extent possible). 
3. Run the demo notebook with our implementation and see how our results compare to theirs. 
4. Once we're confident our version works, modify it to deal with the RLHF Trojan competition.
5. Try to win the competition!

### Cons of the proposed approach

1. We're making use of a lot of code that has already been written.
2. Steps 3 and beyond require a lot of compute. 

### Pros of the proposed approach

1. Less work that a more bespoke approach.
2. We get quickly to the most interesting part (in my opinion).

## Misc.

**You need to request access to LLaMA-2 from Meta%** and it could take **2 days** for it to be granted! You can do that [here](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/).
